% MOTIVATION
% %
As computing is getting more ubiquitous in our lives, modern software applications and computer infrastructures are getting increasingly complex and require huge financial investments.

% PROBLEM STATEMENT
% %
In this context, knowing how to design and optimize computer systems and networks is one of the most important skills for software engineers and a strategic asset for companies, as it provide them with a competitive advantage, both in terms of technology and investment.

% APPROACH
% %
In this technical report we propose a next-event simulation model to analyze the performance of a two-layer Fog-like system that leverages an off-loading policy to minimize response-time.
%
First, we describe how we implemented the multi-stream pseudo-random number generator, that is a fundamental building block of any next-event simulation.
%
Then, we describe the performance model in terms of goals, conceptual, specification, computational model and verification.

% %
% RESULTS
% %
The experimental results show (i) the satisfactory randomness degree of the adopted pseudo-random number generator and (ii) the effectiveness of our model to study the system so as to, for example, tune it in order to achieve better performance.

% %
% CONCLUSIONS
% %
Although the promising results, we conclude our work delineating possible improvements for our model.
