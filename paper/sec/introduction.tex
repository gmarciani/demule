% WORK INTRODUCTION
% %
As computing is getting more ubiquitous in our lives, modern software applications and computer infrastructures are getting increasingly complex and require huge financial investments.

% PROBLEM STATEMENT
% %
In this context, knowing how to design, redesign and optimize computer systems and networks is one of the most important skills for software engineers because it can guarantee companies a competitive advantage, both in terms of technology and investment.

% APPROACH
% %
In this technical report we propose a next-event simulation model to analyze the performance of a two-layer Cloud system that leverages an off-loading policy to minimize response-time.

% PAPER ORGANIZATION
% %
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:random-number-generation} we describe the pseudo-random number generator adopted to generate random variates for the next-event simulation model.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:modeling} we describe the the next-event simulation model in terms of goals, conceptual, specification, computational model and verification.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} we show the experimental results about the randomness of the adopted pseudo-random number generator and the performances recorded by our model.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:usage} we show how to configure and run experiments and some sample outputs to provide a better idea of what has been created.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we conclude the paper summing up the work that has been done.
