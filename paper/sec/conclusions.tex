% SUMMARY
%%
In this work we propose a next-event simulation model for a two-layer Cloud system, leveraging a custom multi-stream Lehmer pseudo-random number generator.

%%
% IMPROVEMENTS
%%
Although experimental results are pretty satisfactory, the proposed solutions could certainly be improved and be subjected to a more in-depth analysis.
%
From an implementation point of view, the proposed solution should be ported from Python to C and leverage multi-threading to achieve better performances, e.g. to speed-up the algorithms to find suitable multipliers for modulus in 64-bit architectures and make the simulation faster.
%
From an analysis point of view, the proposed random number generator should be tested more extensively, e.g. taking into account more tests of randomness, and a generator with a 64-bit modulus and less number of streams should be developed. 
%
Finally, the simulation model should be extended so as to 
(i) take into account more performance metrics, such as utilization, 
(ii) study the influence of different server selection policies, e.g. equity-selection, and 
(iii) achieve more performance evaluation goals, such as forecasting with respect to the variation of the arrival processes.
